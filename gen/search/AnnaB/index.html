		<h1>Searching for Anna</h1>
		<p>Anna Spreen is my Great-great-great Grandmother on my father&#39s paternal side. One of my goals has been to find her maiden name and where she was from. When I started my journey to become a professional genealogist, I decided that Anna and her husband Fredrick Spreen would be my project for the quarter. There were a few things I knew about her and several records that we had with her name on them. One of the biggest clues I had was that she listed her birthplace as Hannover, not just Germany or Prussia like her husband. Going on this, I figured I would start with what I had and take a look at all the different records I had for Anna.  </p>

			<p>The following is a summary of the documents that I had easy access to at the beginning of my research. There were also several newspaper articles from Quincy area newspapers where Anna and the family were on lists of letters at the post office. Her picture, to the right, was in the Harris Bible</a><a href="#fn1">[1]</a> which I inherited. The titles of each source are links to FamilySearch, find-a-grave or other document sources that should be free to view, although some require an account.

        <h1>Summary of Life</h1>
            <p>Born in Hannover sometime around 1809, Anna immigrated to the United States, first settling in the Wheeling area of Virgina. It isn't known where or when she got married to Frederick, but it would be assumed that it would have been sometime around her immigration. Here she and Fred had her first daughter, Catherine Anna in November of 1842. They moved to Quincy, Illinois between 1842 and 1848 when their second daughter, Dorathy was born. In the 1850 census they show up living in Quincy. In the 1860 Census they are also living in Quincy, but this time with a second family, the Schoup Family. In 1867, their daughter Dorathy gets married to Louis Kespohl in Quincy. Sometime in 1869, Anna passes away and is buried at Woodland Cemetery. Other records from the Quincy newspapers show that she and her family were receiving regular correspondence, including letters from Germany.
        <hr>
		<h1>Clues from the records</h1>		
		<p>Even though I had the death certificate of my great-grandmother in my possession for sometime, it was the first time I had really looked at it. I had not seen that the maiden name of my Great-great-grandmother was actually listed. 
		<p>A second item I picked up for the first time was the fact that there was a second family living with Frederic and his family and the wife of the family said her birthplace was the same as Anna, Hannover, Germany. I had always thought it was interesting that Frederic said his birthplace was Prussia and his wife was born in Hannover. I figured with this information I might be able to track them back to their birth families. Now with the added information that someone else listed as a birthplace as Hannover, maybe that was a relative, particuarly maybe a sister.
		<p>The records also brought up a few questions. What was Anna&#39s actual name? She went by Hannah in 1850, in the 1860 census she was Anna and for her daughter's marriage record she was Cath. My guess was that her name was either Anna or Hannah Catherine, but I couldn't be sure which first name was correct or what order was correct since German names are known to have three or four middle names and the person doesn't necessarily go by the first name. 
		<p>The birthdate also was an unknown. It most likely was as her find a grave year being correct. Census records normally go off of the age of a person and therefore could be as much as six months off in which year they were born. 
		<hr>
		<h1>Continuing the search</h1>
		<p>There are a few items of information that I need for Anna or possibly Margaret which will allow me to find where they were born. Since I have the last name, it would help to have an actual birthdate so I can search for a specific birth record. Where might I be able to find this information?		
        <ul>
			<li>Cemetery Records</li>
            <li>Obituaries and Newspapers</li>
            <li>Other family members death certificates</li>      
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Woodland Cemetery</h2>
		<p>Find a grave allows you to search via the plot. Looking at what other people that were buried in the plot might show further relationship with others.
		I found that the plot: <b>Block 10, lot 224</b> belonged to Frederick Spreen.</b><a href="#fn7">[7]</a>
		
		<p><b>Those buried in Block 10, lot 224 of Woodland Cemetery:</b>
		<br>Anna C. Dempsey - 1839 - 1909
		<br>Isabell Dempsey - unknown - 22 December 1865
		<br>Dora M. Kespohl - 2 Oct 1876 -2 8 Oct 1973
		<br>Dorothea L Spreen Kespohl - 1848 - 22 Mar 1929
		<br>Herman F. Kespohl - 1869 - 3 September 1950
		<br>Louis J. F. Kespohl - 1839 - 28 October 1921
		<br>John Schaub - 29 march 1802 - 18 May 1862
		<br>John Schaub - 1847 - 25 December 1911
		<br>Lewis Schuab - 1837 - 1890
		<br>Margaret Schuab - 31 March 1807 - 15 May 1887
		<br>Anna Spreen - 1809 - 1869
		<br>Frederick "Fred" Spreen - 1813 - 1 March 1895
		
		<p>Recognizing the Schaub family from the 1860 census, this strengthens the possibility that they are family. Anna Dempsey is John and Margaret's daughter. Dorothea Kespohl is Fred and Anna's daughter. There is no more information on find-a-grave for Anna, but Margaret has a birthdate, therefore she can be searched for in German parish records to see if her birth and baptism record can be found.

        </a>
        <p>Using the search term of "Spreen" in the search engine, I come up with 31 pages between January 1838 and December 1899. Of these, most of them were <a href="https://blog.newspapers.com/utilizing-unclaimed-letter-lists-in-the-newspapers/">lists of letters at the post office</a>. There are returns from 1869, indicating that there propbably isn't an obituary for Anna within this database. There is a mention of Fred Spreen's death in The Quincy Daily Journal on March 2nd, 1895. 
        <p>Using the search term "Schaub" there were a total of 2 pages, both of which were for Louis Schuab's death reported by The Quincy Daily Journal and The Quincy Journal on April 12th, 1890. 
        <p>Looking specifically in the month that Margaret died, I also find her obituary<a href="#fn8">[8]</a>. Even though it is short, it has a wealth of information. The year she immegrated, 1834 is given. She too settled at first in Virgina where she married her husband. Also, the year she moved to Quincy with her family, 1848. With this inforatmion, I can look for a paper trail for her and see if Anna might be also in the same place or on the same records. 
        <h2>Newspaper.com paper search</h2>
        <p>After not finding inforamtion about Anna in the Quincy database, I searched with simular terms for her in the newspaper.com database. Here too there isn't any good hits for obituaries or other articles about Anna. I did find another mention in Atchison, Kansas about Fred Spreen and his daughter Dora. These are good information to keep for Fred and the Kespohl family, but they don't add to the conversation about Anna and Margaret. 
    <hr>
    <h1>Margaret Schaub</h1>
    <p>With Margaret's possible maiden name and her birthdate, I search on Ancestry.com database <i><a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/61456/">Germany, Lutheran Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1518-1921</a></i>. Using the most restrictive search of "Margaret Brickwede Born: 31 March 1807", I come up with one record: 
    <p><b>Germany, Lutheran Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1518-1921</b>
    <br>Name: Margaretha Elisabeth Brickwede
    <br>Event Type: Taufe (Baptism)
    <br>Birth Date: 31 M&auml;r 1807 (31 Mar 1807)
    <br>Baptism Date: 03 Apr 1807 (3 Apr 1807)
    <br>Baptism Place: Badbergen, Bersenbr&uuml;ck, Hannover, Deutschland (Germany)
    <br>Father: Hermann Henrich Brickwede
    <br>Mother: Luica Elsabein Meesmans

    <p>This is a likely record, but how can I prove it? One is does Margaretha have a sister Anna born in 1809? Does she have a sister named Catherine? Using the place and the last name, I searched for any siblings that Margaretha might have.

<p>A total of nine children were found in this search. One meets the time frame for Anna's birthyear and two have the name Anna Catherina. Now the question is, who is Anna? Or is she not listed? Since the name Cath was used for her daughter's marriage record, that puts some conflict into her being Ana Maria, who is the correct age. We have not seen her use Maria in any record that we have found. It is possible that she is Anna Catherina born in 1803, but would she have changed her age? One way to find out is if any of these individuals can be traced forward.
