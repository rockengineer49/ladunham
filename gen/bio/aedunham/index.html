		<p><img alt="Arthur Earl with a cow" class="imgrgt" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ABLVV86mMJYh9g5oLYUFCnFSxgD0rSviQEAYocrYxWXdLBxAGR6t4gKuQlpZEj4OKAuToVMbJQomVmq4Gx6ZZysRRJvGfg7cyRP-Fr1RJAlk0aHNuQ-OD21uC-Bg5lHWwyYHYXFAfZMKmWSFjRO60LSutCI_=w1390-h966-s-no" width="400" />
        
        <p>Arthur Earl was born in Downs, Osborne, Kansas on 2 May 1895 to Arthur Leslie and Estella Addie Dunham.  He was Arthur and Estella's fourth child.  His oldest brother, Edwin Harris died shortly after birth and his two older sisters, Catherine Elizabeth and Eleanor Anna died when they were 7 and 9.  His two younger brothers, Archibald William and Charles Raymond both lived to adulthood.

<p>Arthur never finished the 8th grade.  Instead he became a machinest apprentice near Eldon, Missiouri then he went on to become a boomer machinest. During this time, Arthur travedled by rail hoping a freight train to get where he was going. He said that the railroad had a habit of getting men to move thier families to an area then lowering thier pay so they would have to stay.  That is the reason that the union got a good hold on the Railroad industry.    

<p>In 1916 Arthur joined the navy being enlisted as a machinist 2nd class. The captain came down to the engine room and started to ask him about the different parts and what they did; Arthur didn't know the captin was testing him. Since Arthur liked to show off he explained everything thourally and the captain was so impressed he promoted him to machinest 1st class.  

<p>During his service he was stationed on two boats, the Osceola II At-47 and the Fishhawk.  The Osceola was first commissioned during the Spanish American war in 1898 and brought out of retirement for WWI when the need for naval ships was apparent.  The fishhawk was a fish hatchery ship that was converted for military use during WWI.  Both ships were on patrol duty near Santiago, Cuba.  They also brought crewmen from other ships to shore because they had a smaller draft.

USS Fishhawk on which Earl served on the USS Fishhawk during WWI in Santiago, Cuba was a fish hatchery comissioned in spring of 1880 and used by the U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries.  During WWI there was a need for ships and it was used as a navy transport because of its small draft. Source <a href="http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/history/ships/fishawk/fishawk.html">NOAA.gov</a></td>
