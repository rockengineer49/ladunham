    <p>Helen Pearl Kottmann was born to Annie Rossie Clark Kottmann and Arthur Francis Kottmann in Culbertson Montana on 14 May 1897. Helen was the oldest of eight children, four boys and four girls. During her early childhood, Helen's father worked for the railroad and they moved from Montana, to Washington back to Montana to Indiana finally to Fall City, Nebraska. 
    <p>Helen graduated from Falls City Senior High School in 1916.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a> After school, she taught school, teaching in Humbolt, Nebraska the year after graduation and Preston, Nebraska in 1921. She also taught second grade at Vernon Nebraska in 1922-1923.
    <p>On 20 June 1923 Helen married <a href="../aedunham/">Arthur Earl Dunham</a> in a double wedding with her Sister Beatrice and Arthur's brother Charlie in Fall City, Nebraska.
    <blockquote>DOUBLE WEDDING - A simple service preformed by Rev. H. F. Reid, pastor of the Presbyterian church, at his home last evening joined in the holy bonds of wedlock lives of two of Falls City's charming young ladies, with that of two of our well known young men. The ceremony was witnessed by only the immediate relatives of the contracting parties. Miss Helen Pearl Kottman became the bride of Mr. Arthur E. Dunham. Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Kottman became the bride of Charles Raymond Dunham, the brides being sisters and the grooms brothers. The brides are the daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur F. Kottman of 622 Wilson street and are graduates of the Falls City high school. The grooms are sons of Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Dunham residents of 711 Wilson street and been residence of the city for the past twelve years during which time they have been employed as machinists in the Missouri Pacific shops. Recently they have been at Sioux City, Iowa, where they have accepted positions with the Chicago Milwaukee & St. Paul R. R., at which place they will make their home in the future. The happy couples left the city last night for their new homes carrying with them the congratulations of their many friends left behind.<a href="#fn2">[2]</a></blockquote>
    <p>Arthur and Helen never did make their home in Sioux City, although they did own some property there.  They ended up making their home in Atchison, Kansas where thier first daughter, Marjory Earline, was born 21 July 1924. There second child, William Arthur was born 11 August 1931.  Arthur and Pearl moved to Bloomfield, New Mexico where Arthur traded with the Indians. There, their third child, John Delbert, or Jack was born on 5 September 1933.  
    <p>While in Bloomfield, the indians used to run through the yard and cut her clothes line that was hanging there.  Helen didn't like that much and ended up threatening them with a gun.  
    <p>They moved back to Atchison after a year in Bloomfield.  
    <p>During the great depression they moved to a farm in Eldon Missouri.  Here there last child, Barbara Helen was born on 17 November 1938. There Arthur worked on the farm raising livestock mostly and Helen raised their family. 
    <p>With the start of World War II, Arthur took a job in Kansas City at Aircraft manufacturer.  Arthur moved to Kansas City first, and Helen stayed in Eldon with the children.
